# PyBlackjack

This is a text-based blackjack game written in Python. This project was made
as part of the [ProgrammingExpert](programmingexpert.io/) course. The
challenge of this project was to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Therefore, you will see all kinds of concepts related to Python OOP in the
source code.

The following Python OOP concepts were used:
- Instance methods and attributes
- Class methods and attributes
- Static methods
- Properties (setters and getters)
- Inheritance

Here is a GIF of how the program should look like:
